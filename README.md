Customer segmentation analysis involves dividing customers into distinct groups based on shared characteristics or behaviors. This project typically leverages data such as demographics, purchasing history, and preferences to identify patterns. Techniques like clustering (e.g., K-means) or classification are used to create segments such as "high-value customers" or "frequent shoppers." The insights gained help businesses tailor marketing strategies, improve customer experience, and optimize resource allocation. This analysis is crucial for understanding customer diversity and driving data-driven decision-making.
